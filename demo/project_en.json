Under the sallow moon, it looked more like a stranded whale carcass, its steel ribs pointing towards a starless sky. Marc parked his old sedan, the engine of which made one last rattle of discontent before falling silent. The silence that followed was heavy, thick, interrupted only by the backwash of the Atlantic, a hundred meters below, against the sharp rocks.\n\nHe crossed the security perimeter, his shoes crunching on the gravel of the driveway. As he approached the main entrance, the noise changed. It was no longer gravel, but glass. Thousands of sparkling fragments littered the ground, as if the sky had cried diamonds. But Marc knew that this glass had nothing celestial about it. It was the rest of the monumental bay window, the one that was Victor Blackwood's pride.\n\nHe entered the living room. The smell of sea salt mingled with the more metallic smell of dried blood. The police had already passed through, taking the body, but they had left behind a scene of desolation. The designer furniture was overturned, the master canvases slashed. In the center of the room, where Blackwood had been found, the glass shards were denser, forming a kind of macabre halo around a dark stain.\n\nMarc took out his flashlight. The beam swept across the raw concrete walls, revealing bullet impacts and deep scratches. This was not a simple burglary gone wrong. It was an execution, methodical and hateful. Blackwood, the \"Crystal King\", had ended his run in the middle of his own creations, broken like a vulgar perfume bottle. Marc crouched near the blood stain, his eyes scanning every gap. He was looking for what the ballistics experts had missed, that tiny detail that did not fit with the apparent violence of the scene. For Marc did not believe in chaos; he believed in the intentions hidden behind every act of destruction. And here, in the middle of these luxury ruins, a very precise intention was waiting for him.",

Among the shards of transparent glass and the rock crystal fragments that made up Blackwood's collection, one color did not belong. A shade of purple, almost organic. Marc took a pair of tweezers from his inner pocket and, with surgical precision, he moved aside two pieces of broken mirror.\n\nEmbedded in a groove in the floor, a ruby red silk thread was waiting for him. It was short, barely three centimeters long, but its texture was of exceptional finesse. Marc brought it to his eyes. This was no ordinary clothing thread. It was damask silk, the kind no longer used except in the restoration workshops of the imperial city or for overpriced textile works of art.\n\nThis thread had not been left there by mistake. It was too well placed, almost staged in this crevice. Marc felt a surge of adrenaline go down his spine. Blackwood often received influential personalities, but few of them wore silk of this quality, and even fewer during a fight to the death. Unless... Marc recalled the rumor running through the underworld of the art market a few weeks earlier. It was whispered that a unique piece, missing since the fall of the tsars, had resurfaced in a private sale. It was called \"The Tsar's Tear\", a red glass object so pure it was mistaken for a giant ruby.\n\nSuddenly, a rustling sound rang out behind him. Marc turned off his flashlight instantly. He remained motionless, plunging into total darkness, his ear strained towards the slightest sigh of sea air in the villa's carcass. A light step, almost imperceptible, was approaching. Someone else was interested in the ruins of the Blackwood villa. Marc slipped his hand towards his weapon, but his fingers closed instead on the evidence bag containing the red thread. It was his only lead, his unique link to a past that many would have preferred to leave buried under the crystal debris. The unknown visitor stopped at the entrance to the living room. Marc held his breath, his heart beating against his ribs like a caged bird.",

It was a place of contrasts, where furnaces spitting orange flames stood alongside workbenches covered in silica dust and tools from another era. Elena, her hair tied in a leather scarf, did not look up from her current piece when Marc walked through the door. She handled a blowpipe with the grace of a conductor, transforming an incandescent mass into a perfect sphere.\n\n\"You're ten years late, Marc,\" she said, her raspy voice muffled by the noise of the fan.\n\"Some say I never arrive, Elena. I'm just passing through.\"\nShe delicately placed the finished object in the annealing oven and turned to him, wiping her calloused hands on her apron. Her black eyes scanned him with an acuity that made Marc uncomfortable. She hadn't changed. Always that same silent authority, the kind you acquire by taming fire and sand.\n\nMarc took out the bag containing the red thread and placed it on the workbench. Elena's face froze. She didn't touch the bag, but her nostrils flared.\n\"Where did you find that?\" she asked, her tone suddenly devoid of all irony.\n\"At Blackwood's. Just after he decided to die in the middle of his mirrors.\"\nElena approached, her headlamp illuminating the ruby thread. Her fingers trembled slightly as she grabbed a jeweler's loupe. The silence in the workshop became heavy, only broken by the hum of the furnaces.\n\"It's not a silk thread, Marc,\" she whispered. \"Well, yes, the sheath is silk. But the core... the core is made of optical glass fibers of a purity I've only seen once in my life. In my grandfather's archives.\"\nShe stood up, her face grave.\n\"You're playing with a fire much hotter than my furnaces. This thread belongs to 'The Glass Spider', a forgery network thought to have been dismantled since the Cold War. If they're back at Blackwood's, it's for one reason.\"",

It was the centerpiece of a secret optical mechanism developed by Nicholas II's engineers. Not for beauty, but for communication. A light reflection system capable of sending encrypted messages across the steppes, undetectable by anyone who did not possess the receiving prism.\"\nMarc leaned against a shelf loaded with glass globes. \"And Blackwood had it?\"\n\"No. He was trying to recreate it. He was using his fortune to fund research into smart glass. He thought he could break the monopoly on satellite communications with a hundred-year-old technology. Someone didn't like the idea of seeing this ghost resurface.\"\n\nMarc's phone vibrated violently in his pocket. An unknown number was displayed. He answered, expecting a voice, but only a sharp hiss answered him, followed by a series of rhythmic clicks. Elena tensed.\n\"Hang up!\" she cried.\nBut it was too late. On the screen in the adjoining living room, connected to the alley's security camera, a silhouette appeared. A man dressed in a long coat, motionless under the fine rain that was beginning to fall. He wasn't looking at the workshop, he was looking at his own wrist, as if he was checking a watch. Or a detonator.\n\nSuddenly, a shockwave made the workshop windows shake. It wasn't a massive explosion, but an intense vibratory frequency. Elena's shelves began to sing, then to scream. In a crash of crystal, dozens of glass works exploded simultaneously, turning the air into a cloud of flying razors. Marc rushed at Elena to pin her to the floor as the workshop's glass ceiling gave way in turn. In the middle of the chaos, Marc's phone was now projecting a red laser onto the opposite wall, tracing geographical coordinates. The threat was clear: the game had begun, and the time for discreet investigations was over. They were now the prey of the Spider.",

There, nestled in a hollow in the valley, stood an ancient industrial glassworks, a monument of red brick and decapitated chimneys. It was here that the \"Crystal King\" had begun his career, long before luxury villas and red carpets. The place breathed abandonment, wild grass forcing through the cracked asphalt of the parking lot.\n\nMarc moved forward, avoiding the carcasses of rusty machines. The air was cold, loaded with a humidity that chilled his bones. He held his weapon with a firm hand, his gaze sweeping across the broken windows that looked like empty eye sockets. Why would Blackwood come back here? Was it a sanctuary or a hiding place? He found a side door ajar, its hinges groaning in the wind.\n\nInside, the atmosphere changed radically. The main hall, immense, was plunged into a bluish gloom. But instead of the expected dust, Marc discovered a state-of-the-art laboratory installed in the center of the nave. Fiber optic cables ran across the floor like technological vines, connecting silent servers to a pressurized glass chamber. In the center of this chamber, suspended by red silk threads identical to the one in the villa, a ruby sphere radiated a pulsing light. The Tsar's Tear. It was not made of ancient glass, but of something much more modern: a photonic processor housed in a crystal shell. Blackwood had not simply found the Tear; he had transformed it into the ultimate communication weapon. Marc approached, fascinated by the toxic beauty of the object, ignoring the shadows that were beginning to detach themselves from the brick pillars.",

Red laser beams crossed the room, all converging on his chest. He was trapped.\n\n\"You've been useful, Marc. You brought the final component without even knowing it.\"\nMarc felt the bag in his pocket. The red thread. He suddenly understood that Elena was not just a friend; she was the key. The thread was not evidence, it was a sensor. By moving it, Marc had activated a proximity beacon.\nSuddenly, the servers around the laboratory went wild. A sharp hiss filled the glassworks. Flames burst from the abandoned gas tanks, instantly turning the building into a furnace. The fire was no accident; it was a cleaning protocol.\n\nMarc had only a few seconds. He fired two bullets into the window of the pressurized chamber, but the glass remained intact. It was bulletproof crystal. Black smoke began to fill the space, making breathing difficult. He saw the silhouettes of the attackers retreating towards the emergency exits, leaving him to burn alive with Blackwood's secret. But Marc had noticed one thing: the Tear was vibrating at the same pace as his phone. Using his mobile screen as a prism, he directed the red laser he had received earlier towards the heart of the sphere. The interaction was immediate. An overvoltage cracked the armored crystal. In an explosion of purple light, the sphere flew into pieces, shattering the partition. Marc dived through the debris, grabbing the core of the Tear before lunging towards a high window as the glassworks structure began to collapse in a crash of glass and flames.",

He held the core of the Tear in his hands, a small prism that seemed to contain a galaxy of circuits. By inserting his camera's memory card into it, he managed to decrypt the last files recorded by Blackwood. What he saw chilled him more surely than the forest wind.\n\nThe video did not show an attack. It showed Victor Blackwood, very much alive, arranging the glass shards himself in the villa. He was meticulously placing the red thread in the groove of the floor. He was configuring the explosives in Elena's workshop. Blackwood was not the victim; he was the architect of his own disappearance. His \"death\" was a massive diversion to clear his debts, eliminate his rivals and, above all, test his communication system in real conditions.\n\nMarc realized with growing horror that he had been Blackwood's toy from the beginning. The model detective, the upright one looking for the truth, was only a pawn used to transport the core from the glassworks to a safer place. The attackers at the glassworks? Mercenaries paid to simulate a fight and ensure Marc escaped with the precious object. Blackwood wanting Marc to \"save\" the Tear of the Tsar to bring it to its final point of transmission. Marc looked at the horizon. In the distance, the old Pointe-Noire lighthouse lit up. It was the highest point on the coast, the only place capable of sending a photonic signal beyond the horizon. It was there that the King of Crystal was waiting for his resurrection.",

Arriving at the top, he found the lantern gallery bathed in blood-red light. Victor Blackwood was there, standing before the lighthouse's monumental optics, his face serene. He was holding a crystal glass in his hand.\n\n\"Hello, Marc. I appreciate your punctuality. Do you have the core?\"\nBlackwood bore no trace of struggle. He looked like he had just come from a gala dinner. Marc stopped a few meters from him, the Tear's prism clutched in his fist.\n\"Why Elena?\" Marc asked in a dull voice.\n\"Sacrifices are necessary for art, Marc. Elena's workshop was the last link to the Glass Spider. This chapter had to be closed. Now give it to me. The signal will go off in three minutes. A new era of control begins.\"\n\nMarc looked at the complex mechanism behind Blackwood. He could have fired, but he knew Blackwood had probably foreseen this outcome. Instead, Marc took out the original red thread bag.\n\"You made a mistake, Victor. You thought I would only see what you wanted me to see. But you forgot that glass doesn't just reflect. It can also refract the truth.\"\nMarc slipped the red thread into the heart of the photonic prism and threw the whole thing not at Blackwood, but directly into the lantern's rotating gears. The silk and optical glass thread got caught in the steel teeth. The mechanism screamed, a spark flew, and the lighthouse's light beam suddenly turned blinding white before going out in a cloud of ozone.\n\nBlackwood rushed towards the lantern, but it was too late. The surge had fried the servers. The Tsar's Tear was no more than a piece of inert glass. The King of Crystal collapsed against the window, looking at the sea which had become dark again. The police were arriving, their sirens climbing the cliff. Marc did not stay for the explanations. He went back down the stairs, leaving behind the extinguished lighthouse and the ghost of a man who had believed he could rule by light. Outside, the rain finally washed away the blood and glass, leaving the world as it was: fragile, but finally rid of its deceptive reflections.",
